# Project Euler Solutions

My attempts at solving Project Euler's problems.

I will mainly use **Rust**, **C**, (_maybe_) **Ada** and other languages that I might want to try, to learn or to practice.

As you might expect, these solutions are not meant to be _optimal_ or even _good_, I just need them to work fine.
